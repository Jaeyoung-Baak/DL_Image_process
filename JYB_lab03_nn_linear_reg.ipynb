        "- A loop is necessary to allow NN training to happen iteratively.\n",
        "- The number of times we want to repeat the cycle is called number of epochs.\n",
        "- Loss functions tell us how far a model's prediction is from the correct answer. PyTorch contains a variety of loss functions, including common MSE (mean squared error = L2 norm), Cross Entropy Loss and Negative Likelihood Loss (useful for classifiers), and others.\n",

        "  - Remember to provide them as tensors. \n",
        "  - Note that ``y`` will have to be correct values that satisfy the formula.\n",
        "2. Define the NN class. \n",

        "  - For linear regression, the output will be a real value, so no output layer activation function is needed.\n",
        "  - Note also that an extra parameter ``hidden_size`` was added to the initialiser\n",
        "3. Create an instance of the NN class\n",

        "4. Define Loss and Optimiser\n",
        "  - for this linear regression problem, we will use the MSE Loss and SGD optimiser\n",
        "5. Training Loop\n",
        "  - Loop through a set number of times, e.g. 100\n",
        "    - forward pass to calculate the predicted values for each input sample and calculate the loss using the loss instance you created earlier\n",
        "    - backward pass to first reset all the gradients ``opt.zero_grad()``, then to calculate the gradients of the loss w.r.t. the params ``loss.backward()`` and finally update the params accordingly ``opt.step()``\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Test the model\n",
        "  - At this point, the model has been trained, i.e. the parameters have been optimised and the loss should be small enough.\n",
        "  - Call ``model()`` with any new number to test what the trained model will predict. See how accurately it performs.\n",
